		<h1> # FIX OWASP 2013 A2: SESSION FIXATION </h1>
		<h2> The Vulnerability </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Brief explanation:<br><br>
				Application functions related to authentication and session management are often not<br>
				implemented correctly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or<br>
				to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities.<br>
<xmp>
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Example code etc.:
				<br><br>
				Using the same session after logging in logging out etc.
<xmp>
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> How attacker exploits this:<br><br>
				If the attacker somehow get's your session, and you use that same session to login<br>
				and the session contains sensitive information (login, password) the attacker <br>
				now has access to your login and password and can use these.
<xmp>

			<li> Impact: CIAaa and some details

                <h2> The Fix </h2>
                <ul>
                        <li> Explain the fix:<br><br>
													Implement new session creation on login and logout and delete <br>
													the previous session.<br>
													When logging in or logging out use: <br><br>
													session_regenerate_id(True);

<xmp>
</xmp>
                        </li>
                        <li> How the fix resolves the issue:<br><br>
													If the attacker somehow get's a hold of your session, and you <br>
													login they can't do anything with that old session as it has been <br>
													deleted from the server and you are using a brand new session, which <br>
													holds your data.
<xmp>
</xmp>
                        </li>
                </ul>
