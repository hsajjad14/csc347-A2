A2:
Broken Authentication and Session Management

Application functions related to authentication and session management are often not
implemented correctly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or
to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities.

# FIX OWASP 2013 A2: SESSION FIXATION
# Check that this application is vulnerable by bringing up firefox developer tools,
# visiting the website, then logging in, notice that the same cookie is used after
# change of privilege.
# Fix this by...
# Destroy current session and get a new session id when change in privilege.
# Check to make sure that the cookie changes when logged in
# Note: Some browsers now protect against reflection attacks, but not all.
# See: http://php.net/manual/en/function.session-regenerate-id.php

fixing this pretty much fixes csrf aswell.


also replace all $_REQUEST with $_POST except for the operation one
