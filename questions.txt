questions:

  1. why isn't my prepared statement not preventing sql injection?
  2. what is the behaviour supposed to be when submitting error's for expressions


notes from oh:
  - for csrf add token to url, also make a new token on every request
  - for sqlmap reset the log
  - for csrf use prepared statements to fix instead of the htmlspecialchars
  - for delete expr:
      $dbconn = pg_connect_db();
      $result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", "DELETE FROM solution WHERE id=$expressionId AND accountId=$accountId");
      $result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());

    insecure direct obj ref, bad exp and account id generation, sql injectible,
    csrf cause we can pass in things into expr id and account id



    bcrypt()
