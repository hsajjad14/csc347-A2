		<h1> # FIX OWASP 2013 A1: SQL Injection, use prepared statements </h1>
		<h2> The Vulnerability </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Brief explanation:
				<br>
				<br>
				Attackers can send manipulate text fields and send part's of sql querries <br>
				that can provide them with private user information.Also they can alter or delete the <br>
				database using injected sql querries.<br>
				They can also use sqlMap to get all the information in the database. <br>
				This violates Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and authentication.

<xmp>
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Example code etc.:
				<br>
				<br>
				Some example code is: <br>
				$query= "SELECT id, username, firstName, lastName, passwd FROM account WHERE username='$user' AND passwd='$password'";<br>
				$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $query);<br>
				$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());<br><br>
				Another example is when adding an expression: <br>
				$dbconn = pg_connect_db();<br>
				$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", "SELECT * FROM solution WHERE expression='$expression'");<br>
				$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array()); <br>
<xmp>
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> How attacker exploits this:
				<br>
				<br>
				The attacker can exploit this using some sql injections
				<a href=sql_injections_example.txt>sql_injections_example.txt</a>
				<br>
				<br>
				They can also use sqlMap like in <a href=A1_sqlmap.txt>A1_sqlmap.txt</a>
<xmp>
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Impact: CIAaa and some details
				<br>
				<br>
				The attacker can use sqlMap to get everything from the database. Violating
				Confidentiality. <br>
				They can also use 'update' querries to change the data in the database Violating
				Integrity. And can delete the entire database, bringing the entire system down
				Violating Availability.

                <h2> The Fix </h2>
                <ul>
                        <li> Explain the fix:
													<br>
													<br>
													Use prepared statements so when querries are sent to the database<br>
													it knows what is paramaters and what is executable querries.<br><br>
													So for this querry that is sent when a user logs in: <br>
													$query= "SELECT id, username, firstName, lastName, passwd FROM account WHERE username='$user' AND passwd='$password'";<br>
													$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $query);<br>
													$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());<br><br>
													It would instead be like: <br>
													$query= "SELECT id, username, firstName, lastName, passwd FROM account WHERE username=$1 AND passwd=$2";<br>
													$stmtname="find_user";<br>
													$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, $stmtname, $query);<br>
													$result = pg_execute($dbconn, $stmtname, array($user, $password));
<xmp>
</xmp>
                        </li>
                        <li> How the fix resolves the issue:<br><br>
													The parameters passed in at pg_execute() let's <br>
													 psql know that these are parameters and not meant to be executed.
<xmp>
